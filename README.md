- Axios
- IP Geolocation API
- React Leaflet (for displaying the map)

## Features

This project includes the following features:

- IP address lookup functionality
- Displaying the user's location on a map using React Leaflet
- Retrieving detailed information about an IP address using the IP Geolocation API
- Displaying relevant data, such as IP address, location, timezone, and ISP

## How to Use

To use this project, clone or download the repository to your local machine. Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies. Then, run `npm start` to start the development server and open the application in your browser.

Enter an IP address in the search field, and the application will retrieve and display the corresponding location information and show it on the map.

The project utilizes the IP Geolocation API to fetch information about the IP address, and React Leaflet to display the map. The Axios library is used to handle HTTP requests.
